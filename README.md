# telepy

Telepy is a custom flight data visualizer software developed by Rowan Jansens for the Olin Rocketry team at Olin College of Engineering.

This GUI is written in Python and is essential a glorified Arduino Serial Plotter with better graphics and functionality.
It has a couple of neat features such as automatic data-logging to file and visualization options for data that would be better left un-plotted.
The program uses PySide6 and QT for the graphical elements as well as the PyQtGraph module to plot the incoming data at high speed.
